# Encryption-Decryption

This project was a fantastic learning experience, helping me delve deeper into the world of enhancing my Python programming skills.

Here's a quick overview of how it works:

Input your message: The user types in a message they want to encrypt.
Encryption: The message is converted into an encrypted form using a simple algorithm.
Decryption: Re-enter the encrypted message to decrypt it back to the original form.

Just try once,
Thankyou.
